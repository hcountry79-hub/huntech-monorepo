Missouri Trout Hunter
Kansas City Metro Area
The greater Kansas City area has seven winter trout lakes on the Missouri side of the state line. There are also winter trout lakes on the Kansas side, but you're on your own there. Historically, there have been at least a couple of lakes each in Johnson County and Wyandotte County, but I don't keep up with Kansas trout news. Sorry! 

​As with all the winter trout lakes, oxygen levels will be good during the winter months, allowing for pursuit feeding, meaning you should have luck casting spinners, crankbaits, jigs, and streamers. However, colder water temperatures cause slower metabolism and will suppress feeding behavior. Focus your efforts early in the season before the temperatures get wicked cold, during unseasonably warm spells, and also as spring approaches. During colder weather, you may have better luck.

Capital Federal Sports Complex​Daily limit is 4 trout, no bait restrictions, three poles may be used

Located in Liberty, this is primarily a baseball park, but there are several small ponds. It was initially just pond #1 that received trout. The updated description from MDC doesn't say this, so all ponds may be stocked with trout now. To find the park, take Old State Hwy 210 east from Hwy 291 for about a mile, turning left into the park. To find the lake, keep left, and drive to the end.
