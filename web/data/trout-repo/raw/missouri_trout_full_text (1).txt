### Lake Taneycomo — key points
**Fishery type and character:** Tailwater below Table Rock Dam with stable cold water and abundant scud/sowbug food, producing large “football‑shaped” trout and strong year‑round fishing. 

**Regulations (zones):**  
- **Zone 1 (760 ft below Table Rock Dam → mouth of Fall Creek):** **Artificial flies and lures only; soft plastics prohibited**; **daily limit 4 trout** (only **1 brown** allowed); **rainbows harvestable only if <12" or >20"**; **brown trout must be >20"**.   
- **Zone 2 (mouth of Fall Creek → Powersite Dam):** **No bait restrictions**; **daily limit 4 trout** (only **1 brown**); **brown trout must be >20"**; **no size restriction on rainbow trout**. 

**Where and how to fish:**  
- **Upper 3 miles** are prime for **wading** (high pressure; best results downstream of the busiest quarter‑mile).  
- **Lower ~20 miles** are best from **boat, bank, or commercial docks**; drifting and locating submerged structure are common tactics. 

**Effective tactics and flies/lures:**  
- **Small scud and sowbug patterns (#14 and smaller), copper‑bodied nymphs, tiny midges, soft‑hackles, glo‑bugs, and san juan/yarn worms** for resident fish.  
- **Big streamers and large lures** for pre‑spawn browns (October–early November); **night fishing** can be productive for large browns using bold silhouettes near the surface. 

**Safety and logistics:**  
- Table Rock Dam gate openings change flows; **sirens warn** before generation — **exit the water immediately** when sirens sound.  
- Guides and boat rentals are recommended for newcomers to reach the best lower‑lake water.
